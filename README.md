# Home-Price-Prediction

Prediction Home Prices in Banglor 
banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.

We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression 

Outline:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature Engineering
3. Outlier Detection and Removal
4. Dimentionality Reduction
5. Gridsearchcv for Hyprparameter Tuning
6. KFoldCrossValidation
7. Model Building


Technology and tools for this project:

1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook

Finally pickle and Jason models are prepared for production.


Summary:
Home price prediction:
•	Data size =13320    hours: 30  
•	Used python for programming language, jupyter notebook for code editor, Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning, Matplotlib for data visualization, Scikit-learn for model building.
•	Removed outlier and reduced dimension by using feature engineering
•	Using Gridsearchcv for hyper parameter tuning 
•	The evaluated score for DecisionTreeRegressor, Lass, and Linear regression are 71, 72, and 84%, respectively.
