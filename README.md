# Home-Price-Prediction-Project

Prediction Home Prices in Banglor 
banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.

We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression 

Outline:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature Engineering
3. Outlier Detection and Removal
4. Dimentionality Reduction
5. Gridsearchcv for Hyprparameter Tuning
6. KFoldCrossValidation
7. Model Building


Technology and tools for this project:

1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook

Finally pickle and Jason models are prepared for production.
